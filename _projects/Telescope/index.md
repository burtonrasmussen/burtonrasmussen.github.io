# First Iteration - 2021
{% include image-gallery.html images="1_Iteration_thumbnail.jpg" height="400" %}
The goal of this project was to add a computer guidance system to my telescope to aid in sharing the view of the stars with family and friends. There is an open-source project called OnStep, which has done all the software development work for people who want to DIY their own GoTo system. 
<br>
## Design Process
- hand drawings
- brainstorming
- decision matrix
- 3D modeling
- Iterative improvements
- solving problems that come up
    - belt tensioning
    - quick assembly/dissassembly
<br>


## Electronics Process
- learning to solder
- assemble electronics for proof of concept
- calibrating configuration parameters

<br>
## What I Learned
- Soldering skills
- I discovered new pain points that came from adding electronics, like more difficult to dissassemble/assemble for transport, and needing more rigidity


# Second Iteration - 2023

# Third Iteration - 2024

# Plans for next iteration
Now having much more experience with the physical design of the telescope, I plan to take all that I've learned and make a "hopefully" final version and bring back the electronics.
